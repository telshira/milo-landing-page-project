# milo-landing-page-project
A quick landing page project using Flexbox

The webpage is one of the project for The Odin Project. In this project, flexbox is used to organize the elements of the webpage into a fluid layout. Flex is used to images and other elements to easily expand and contract as the webpage size changes.

The image photos are from my own photo library of my dog Milo. Quotes and main text are generated from ChatGPT.
