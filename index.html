        <h1>Milo: Small Dog, Big Life</h1>
        <p><strong>Meet Milo</strong> – a small but mighty white and tan Border Terrier with a heart as big as his appetite! Full of energy and charm, Milo lives for playtime, belly rubs, and snuggly hugs. Whether he's chasing after toys or curling up on the couch, he brings joy and laughter to every moment. Don't let his size fool you—this little guy can out-eat just about anyone and still have room for treats. With his scruffy face and wagging tail, Milo is the ultimate mix of mischief, love, and endless cuddles.</p>
