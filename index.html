      <p class="quote">‚ÄúIn Milo‚Äôs world, love isn‚Äôt spoken ‚Äî it‚Äôs felt in the warmth of a cuddle, the joy of a tail wag, and the quiet loyalty of a gaze that says, you‚Äôre my whole world. He doesn‚Äôt need words to tell you he cares; he shows it in every playful bounce, every gentle nudge, every moment spent simply by your side. To walk through life with Milo is to be reminded, daily, that the truest companionship is soft, steady, and unconditional ‚Äî a love that asks for nothing but gives everything.‚Äù</p>
